# scienzaexpress.risetypes

Collection of content types for Scienza Express's RISE CMS.

## Features

Several very simple content types are available ("Libro", "Albo", etc.).

These new content types are "containers". Each content type has an action that enables the operator to create a number of sub-folders (different for each type) suitable to accommodate all files that that type needs in order to be completed.

## Installation

Add to buildout or, if using `pip`, just run `pip install .../scienzaexpress.risetypes`

Restart your instance, visit the add-on admin page and install the product.
